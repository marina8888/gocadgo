# gocadgo


## To Do  
[x] Add depedencies <br>
[x] Add example code and readme. <br>
[ ] Add link to documentation <br>
[ ] Correct code for P and Q calcs <br>
[ ] ensure network is connected correctly and propagates <br>
[ ] get the fields to actually print (somehow) <br>

## Installation

```bash
pip install gocadgo
```
In testing and planning stages - do not use. 


## Basic Usage

```python
    from gocadgo import set_boundary, Network, show_fields

    # set boundary conditions: 
    my_inlet = set_boundary(T_in=300,
                 P_in=101325,
                 m_in=0.1, 
                 P_out=101325,
                 T_out=300, 
                 gas_type="N2"
                 )
    
    # create mesh and run network: 
    sky_train = Network(8, 8, 20, my_inlet)
    
    # display fields of interest: 
    show_fields(sky_train, 'q')
```
