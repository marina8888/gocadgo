# gocadgo

## To Do

- [x] Add depedencies <br>
- [x] Add example code and readme. <br>
- [ ] Add link to documentation <br>
- [ ] Correct code for P and Q calcs <br>
- [ ] ensure network is connected correctly and propagates <br>
- [x] get the fields to actually print (somehow) <br>

## Installation

```bash
pip install gocadgo
```

This code creates a Network of Cell elements, with heat transfer properties approximated to heat transfer in the pipe of
a heat exchanger. The cells in the network are connected using a pre-defined flow defintion, and the solution is updated
iteratively.

## Basic Usage

```python
    from gocadgo import set_boundary, Network, show_fields

# set boundary conditions: 
my_inlet = set_boundary(T_in=300,
                        P_in=101325,
                        m_in=0.1,
                        P_out=101325,
                        T_out=300,
                        gas_type="N2"
                        )

# create mesh and run network: 
sky_train = Network(8, 8, 20, my_inlet)

# display fields of interest: 
show_fields(sky_train.network, 'T')
```

### Documentation

## How Conjugate Heat Transfer is Calculated

Heat exchange transfer rate can be approximated by the equation below. In a parallel flow heat exchanger, there is a
balance in the Q values of the two cells.

Q = m_c * C_p * (T_out - T_in)

### Function Exceptions

Exceptions generated by the underlying Argon2 hashing function are raised under the `Argon2Error` class which can be
imported as follows:

```python
from pyargon2 import Argon2Error
```
